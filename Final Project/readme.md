## Part I: Summary
[Mindmap Created by Whimisical]

### 1. Background and Motivation

This paper is based on the Blockchain technology and the different systems of voting. The real world issue in this paper is voting, and how to make it secure and transparent through blockchain. Applications scenarios are any vote in any institution.

-- provide citations to explain background info (quotation)

### 2. Research Questions

The paper answers the question of how to use blockchain to enhance e-voting. This is an important question because e-voting can allow us to have all the positive of pen and paper voting (security, paper trace) with that of e-voting (speed, easier to handle data). The questions are not answered by current literature because the current blockchain e-voting implementations have limitations (need more clarity on this. I don't actually know why the author presented a new way of e-voting, because he does not explicitly mention how his method is improving things)

-- cite sources for definitions

### 3. Methods

The research methodology is model. The paper shows how the blockchain system works for e-voting. The methodology is as such because blockchain is a technology and presenting it through a model is the best way to explain it.

The voting process provided in this paper is divided into three parts:

*election setup
*voting
*counting and verification

### 4. Intellectual Merits

The Auditable Blockchain Voting System (ABVS) presented in the paper "fulfills all the requirements of the electronic voting systems and delivers an e-voting solution which provides voters with full audit and verification capabilities"

-- u must cite literature to tell where the paper belongs. cite classical papers to dtermine discipline. talk about uniqueness. talk about how it motivates


### 5. Practical Impacts

The practical impacts of this paper are quite clear. THe ABVS is an e-voting system that circumvents all of the current liabilities of e-voting systems while mainting all of its positives. This will allow the process of voting become much more smooth, secure, and transparent.

## Part II: Critics 
[Mindmap Created by Whimisical]

### 1. Economics for Computer Science: Incentives in Computer Science

From a CS standpoint, this paper is quite useful. The advent of blockchain technology with Nakamto's paper has revitalized Computer Science. E-voting is one of the fields that is gaining from this revolution. The ABVS uses sound CS fundamentals to tackle voting electronically. For instance, the use of "Vote Identification Token (VIT) which is a unique alphanumerical code randomly selected by the voters to identify their votes in the blockchain and in the audit trail while remaining anonymous" is relevant.

### 2. Computer Science for Economics: Practicality in Economics

For an economics standpoint, mechanism design is definitely relevant in voting. We ought to create a system that guarantees the most desired outcomes happen. This paper does not really argue about what kind of voting system we will have (e.g., ranked choice voting). However, from a mechanism design standpoint, having hardware and software that cannot be tampered with guarantees that whatever voting system we implement, it will be implemented seucrely and transparently.

## Part III: Inspirations
[Mindmap Created by Whimisical]

### 1. Interdisciplinary Research

Even before enrolling in Professor Luyao's class, I was a firm believer of interdisciplinary research. I believe we are at a forefront of civilization where sciences can rarely exist in a vacuum. However, I have noticed that for most interdisciplinary research what tends to happen is that we choose Computer Science and attach its computational ability to some other discipline. For example, Economics and CS, Biology and CS, Physics and CS, etc... What would be interesting to examine is other combinations, such as philosophy and other fields. For instance, in the covid-19 pandemic in the US, doctors had to choose to whom to give ventilators, meaning that they essentially chose who lived and who died. This question is philosophical (ethical), but also requires input from biology (health).

### 2. Research for Real-world Practices

I believe that practical impacts are desirable. However, we should also not neglect research that touches on theoretical because sometimes those ideas are the catalyst for incredible future progress. To push the boundary of knowledge, researchers should be funded for purely theoretical work that may not have practical applications. This is because sometimes we might need decades of research that produces no practicality to reach an incredible inflection point down the line.

### 3. Future Professional Growth

I think that this class taught me the value of knowledge and research. Professor is a very enthusiastic person and that has translated to me being excited about research and academia in general. I am not sure if I will stay in academia in the future and do research. However, what I plan to do is that whatever job I will have, whether in industry or in academia, I will always strive to challenge myself by attempting to expand humanity's collective knowledge.
