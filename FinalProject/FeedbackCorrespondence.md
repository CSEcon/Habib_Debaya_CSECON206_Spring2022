# Feedback from Ray:
I enjoyed very much and learned a lot by reviewing Habib’s Final Product For ECON/CS 206. Let me brief on the good parts and areas to be improved.
Good parts:
Habib answered all questions clearly and concisely (I don’t like long and obscure sentences and Habib avoided all these) and strictly followed Prof. Zhang’s requirements.
Habib generates some fresh and inspiring ideas, such as those in Part II and III, when he tries to illustrate from ECON and CS perspectives and share his understandings about interdisciplinary research.
Habib formatted his final project in a very organized way
Habib states that he is still working on the stuff at the end so that readers won’t be confused
Areas to be improved
The read-me file of the GitHub folder is not correctly formatted as Prof. Zhang suggests. You should include your name, bio, picture, links, and table of content clearly. You may also drag previous code assignments and problem sets into the same file as a part of our final product.
Citations haven’t been added. But I do recognize you are still building your work block, just as you mentioned at the page bottom. It’s fine, just remember to include in-text citations and bibliography.
I would suggest have a glossary table for some terminologies, such as e-voting you mentioned intensively. Readers can find answers in the passage, but it would be better to separately introduce them somewhere in a table, if time allows. But I believe it’s not a necessary.
Overall, this is a wonderful final project. Maybe further consider if there is a need to include at least one figure or picture. But it’s already almost perfect in general. During my last college course, I feel very happy and honored to have Habib as my classmate and friend. We discuss and share wisdoms, and I have been enjoying it very much. In the future, I also would like to visit Tunisia!

Subject: Revision and resubmission of the final project
Dear Ray,
First of all, I want to share my gratitude for your effort and time to look over my work. I have found your comments accurate and constructive. I will take some space here to reply to your main concerns by sharing the amendment that I will be implementing to my final project.
First, you have kindly reminded me to include my previous assignments to my GitHub repo. In fact, I had done revisions to Problem Sets 1 & 2 and Coding Assignments 1 & 2 without including them to my repository. They have now been included. Thank you for the heads-up.
Second, your reminder on citations is very helpful. I believe that citations are an important part of any academic work. I will pay close attention to my citations in the final draft of the project.
Third, I believe that your suggestion to add a glossary table is very astute. I agree that glossary tables help with the overall understanding of academic work. I will be including a glossary table at the end of the markdown file to explain any and all cryptic terms. I will also make sure that I consult primary sources to obtain the needed definitions.
I want to extend my thanks again to you, Ray. Any academic work is as good as the feedback it receives. It has been a pleasure to read through your comments with the goal of improving my initial draft. As for your trip to Tunisia, you are welcome at any time to visit! I will treat you to many tasty North African dishes :-).
Sincerely,
Habib
